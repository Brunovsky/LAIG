\section{Initial setup}

On the zip's root directory (above \textttd{LAIG/}) initiate the HTTP server, for example with \textttd{python3 -m http.server 8080 &}

The initialize the Pente server, run \textttd{sicstus} or equivalent in the \textttd{LAIG/plog/} folder. In the \textttd{PROLOG} console, run commands

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}[c]{.25\textwidth}
\ttfamily
\begin{verbatim}
compile('main.pl').
server.	
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

\section{Start a game}

Press one of the four playing modes in the GUI on the right (White vs Black).

If White is Bot, you should immediately see it playing in the center of the board.

\section{Undo}

You can undo every move (recursively). You may undo moves while the bot is still thinking;
the server will finish processing the request normally but the response will be discarded.

\section{Rules}

First move (White) must be played in the center.

Changing rules in the GUI, as well as the Bot parameters, only takes effect on a new game.

\section{How to Play}

As simple as could be expected --- just click on the board intersection you would like to play on.
Every other action is implemented through the GUI.
